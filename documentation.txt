Trap handling
Traps need the attributes in the db:
    _level (general hardness of trap)
    _agil  (minimum agility needed to not be hurt)
    _strength (minimum strength needed to not be hurt)
    _damage (damage inflicted if you fail the agil/strength check)
_type   (style of trap) 
the agil and strength can be 0 if it's easy to avoid but generally there should be SOME danger here

Traps need the following sound

name_defeat.wav  (sound to play if you fail the trap check)
name_sprung.wav  (sound to play when finding a trap that has already been activated)
name_start.wav   (sound to play when activating the trap)
name_survive.wav (sound to play when you win the trap check)
